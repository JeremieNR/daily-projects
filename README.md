**Project Files:**
- fubonacci_sequence.py: A Python Function that returns a generated list of the Fibonacci sequence from 0 up to x (inclusive).
- is_prime.py: A Python Function that returns True if the given input is a prime number, False otherwise. It requires x >= 2.
- quadratic_equation_solver.py: A Python Function that returns a list of all the roots of a Quadratic Equation, false if there are no Real Roots. Requires that 'a' cannot be equal to zero.
- collatz_conjecture.py: A Python Function that returns the result of Collatz Conjecture for n as a list of all numbers. Requires 'n' to be greater or equal to 1.
- newtons_method_squareroot.py: A Python Function that returns the approximate square root of 'n' (within 'm') by using Newtons Method.
- sum_digits.c: A C code Function that returns the sum of all digits in integer x. It requires that input x must be a non-negative integer.
- time_dilation.c: A C code Function that returns the dilated time from the given time and velocity. Note: t is in seconds and v is in meters per second.
